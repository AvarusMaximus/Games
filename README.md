# Games
Each folder contains a game. To access a game use the .psyexp file if you have psychopy. 
If not, use the .py file. The .xlsx files store the parameters of the game. Make sure that while running the .py file, the .xlsx files are in the same folder.
## Instructions
1. Install the psychopy module using 'pip install psychopy'
2. Store the .py file and the .xlsx file in the same folder
3. Run the .py file
4. Enjoy!
